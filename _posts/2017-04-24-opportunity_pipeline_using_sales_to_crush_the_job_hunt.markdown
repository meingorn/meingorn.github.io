Here at Flatiron School it’s our last week of classes, meaning everyone is getting geared up for the job hunt. We’ve had a couple of lectures about networking, and thrown at us quite a few times was the analogy of the job hunt as a sales process. Before embarking on the codelyfe, I was in sales for two years, a 6-month portion of which I worked with the national team mostly reaching out to people via email and phone calls and selling them tens-of-thousands of dollars in advertising. Since this knowledge has given me some skills that will help me crush the job hunt, I figured I’d document the basics to do the same. Without further ado: the tech job pipeline: 
 
[Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o1lR-ELX9kQWo8VQv4CoMRcZgvH6WZ4RwEA2kLhe6x4/edit?usp=sharing) to the basic pipeline I’ve outlined below, feel free to work along with the steps to develop your own. 

(disclaimer: none of the below features anything that could be construed as proprietary knowledge of my previous employer, everything written here I consider to be part of any sales-team’s basic process, save for slight elaboration which is my own interpretation of my personal experiences. If you think there are any issues whatsoever, please reach out)

**Step 1(Inactive): **

Make a big list. Most figures I’ve read/heard will state 50-100 applications before a junior dev job offer, so find 50 or so companies you want to work for. Start with the ones you have thought about previously, I’ve taken the initial format from a classmate (shoutout Gee!), who has graciously and intelligently opted to “web 2.0 this shit” and open source it. Really, the only criteria you need to add something in here is “would I work for this company”, and maybe look at where they’re offices are located. Careful not to go overboard on this step, as companies you weren’t aware of will fill the pipeline as you network. Conversely, don’t put too much thought into picking only your top companies, as you’ll have time to obsess over that later. I’m starting with about 60.

**Step 2 (Uncalled):**

In sales, the act of “vetting” - assessing which leads you want to work at a given time - is one of the most important parts of the process. More than once I’ve seen a great vetter make a mediocre salesperson a lot of money. In moving something from ‘inactive’ to ‘uncalled’ you are making the mental distinction that you are preparing to reach out to the company in the next 1-2 weeks.

Once you put something in your uncalled, you’ll need to add a contact (can be HR, but preferably it’s someone you know personally or via a mutual connection). List this person’s name and link to their Linkedin page. It doesn’t matter if they see you viewed their page. Lot’s of reasons for this, but the most important in my view is that you become comfortable putting yourself out there. That person may see you viewed their page, and it might make them vaguely more familiar with who you are, which is a positive. You want to come off as human, not desperate, just a job seeker not ashamed to be seeking a job. 
In your process, you’ll want to bring 5 or so fresh jobs into your Uncalled a week. Study up, read up on your contact, on recent news on the company. Feel confident speaking somewhat authoritatively(not arrogantly) about the company. This is the time to get excited about a company: what’s their stack? Have you worked with their API? Are they doing cool stuff with VR headsets? Write it all down and get pumped; enthusiasm transfers. 
Keep in mind, networking or other introductions may cause things to be put straight into Trying-To(next step), so if you are able to anticipate an introduction, do your homework. For example, successful engineers often come to speak at Flatiron. I always read up on them until I find enough to ask a great question to them during their Q&A, which will create a great first impression - more on that in a moment. 



Once you feel you have enough information to reach out to your contact, you’re ready to initiate contact. 

**Step 3(Trying-To): **

Put a lead into your Trying-To once you have initiated contact. You’ll want to make sure that notes with any helpful information are filled in, as well as a concrete next step that will bring you closer to getting that interview. What you don’t want is to have an oversaturated (20/30+) trying to, otherwise you won’t be able to stay on top of your leads effectively enough. The best way to do this is to not half-ass your process, particularly that first step. 

If you’ve done a good job with your uncalled, you’ll already have plenty of talking points about the company at hand, as well as a good idea of who you’re talking to. If your first contact is email, make sure it’s a real stunner: concise, well-written, thoughtful, not talking about yourself too much, genuine, and ending in a question that elicits a response. The last part is perhaps the most important, because if done correctly will make the next steps of the process very clear, which will save you a lot of sleep.

Ideally, you have a great first contact, they refer you to HR, you mention to HR that X important person said we should speak, and you get an interview set up promptly. While this sequence of events will almost never happen this cleanly, it is important to visualize it in your mind so as not to miss out or over complicate any good opportunities. A couple of important concepts around this theory: 

Relentless Positivity:

You’ll be rejected a lot. Learn to get pleasure from closure. Never assume you were rejected or are being ignored out of malice. People are busy, and you’re probably near the bottom of a long list of priorities. Don’t let it discourage you ever. I’ve seen enough miracles happen to know that this isn’t out of the realm of possibility: “We need an engineer yesterday! Wasn’t there that one guy reaching out a few weeks ago? He seemed nice, give him a call.” So in the meantime, keep your head up, reach out to other leads if something is stalled, and try and be an enjoyable person to talk to. 

Polite Persistence:

There is a fine line between being a nuisance and being on-top of your shit. Be weary of the former, but acknowledge that if something has been in your trying-to for a month with no reply (say, application sent with follow up email), sometimes it’s good to follow up again. Then again, if you’ve followed up several times, it may be best to throw the lead back into your Inactive for a month or two and focus your energy elsewhere. If they have your contact info, there’s always a chance they’ll follow up when you least expect it. 

Clarity of Purpose:

Obviously you want a job, but often times in the process things can get confusing. I.e. “We had a few drinks at this meetup and talked about Rick and Morty for three hours, is it awkward if I ask for a referral to HR?” Oftentimes quandaries like this can lead to leads getting stale, which leads to you being forgotten. Indecision kills deals, which is why it is important to envision how you want the process to go, so you can seize on any opportunity that may arise to move the needle closer to your goal. 

The above rules are things I learned mostly from sales books and proved invaluable throughout my sales career. If you use them right, you will have a lean Trying-To, meaning everything has concrete next-steps, and nothing has gone too long without a point of contact. If all goes well, you’ll get yourself an interview, at which point you can bring the lead into the next stage. 

**Step 4(Interview Set):** 

There’s plenty online about tech interviews, and having not undergone one myself yet, I won’t speculate too much. Here are some deal-closing strategies I will apply: 
Prep hard. If it’s an HR interview, do your homework and come with the best questions you possibly can about the company. If it’s in-person, arrive early, dress sharp, do whatever you need to do to come off confident and relaxed. You’ve heard all of this before, but if you actually do all of these things, it will already set you ahead of the pack. 
Send Follow-Ups. Always know where you stand. Be a pleasure to interact with.

It’s an old saying in sales that people don’t buy products, they buy people (like your personality, not literally). As annoying as it is to come to terms with, (‘they’re surely buying from me because our products are superior to the competition, right?!”) it’s true as hell. No one buys advertising from you if you’re a jerk, and even if you’re the world’s top engineer being a jerk won’t help you, so be nice to interact with, because people will think back on you fondly. 

**Step 5(Waiting): **

![](http://imgur.com/AmfDH75.jpg)
This section will be sparse. Keep it that way. You’ve done all you can and you’re waiting on an answer. If it’s a ‘yes’, congratulations! If it’s a ‘no’, assess if you would still consider working for that company in 3-6 months time. If you would, put the lead with all of its info back into Inactive. If you’re sick of the company and never want to hear from them again, put them back into Inactive. If no, seriously f*** that company they were a bunch of jerks, delete it. Whenever you get a ‘no’, do your best to assess why you got the no as to improve your chances moving forward (remember, you’ll repeat the process a good 20-100 times, so save yourself some time and learn from your mistakes). This is also why overloading yourself with interviews will screw you over, you need time to find your weak-points and fix them. Couldn’t reverse-search a binary tree? Learn it and write a blog post about it. This pipeline is designed to give you a distributed workflow that increases in effectiveness over time. It should probably be a built-in feature of LinkedIn, but don’t pitch them that idea because it’s mine and they’re hiring engineers ;)

There’s another saying from the old sales movie Glengarry Glen Ross that gets thrown around a lot (mostly) jokingly in sales circles: - “ABC, Always Be Closing.” It took me a long time before i realized that this is the surest way to success - always bring value. It sounds like a joke, but if you’re following all of the steps above, and every interaction is not only pleasant, but gives that person even a little bit of a reason to think that you might be qualified, that little extra value might be the one little thing that makes an employer choose you over them. This post is full of little things, little value points that if done in one or two scenarios aren’t likely to do much. However, they will add up over time (sales is a numbers game, after all), and that little extra bit of effort can lead to someone who gave you a ‘no’ for perfectly valid reasons (‘we found a dream candidate who was way more qualified, but Max was great’) to refer you to his VP of engineering friend at Y company. That’s what ABC means - give people so many reasons to give you a chance that one of them might stick. And if it doesn’t, learn and repeat.
