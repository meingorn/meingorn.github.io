     Two weeks ago many sites online experienced a security leak known as Cloudbleed, in which the popular internet service site Cloudflare’s servers were compromised and a large amount of user data was leaked. Such events like this have become commonplace, in which large data troves of user data from large websites become public, putting our private information out there at the disposal of anyone who should choose to use it. Such events often have a paralyzing effect, but as someone who has put off the process of locking down my data for years, I thought I’d take this opportunity to throw together a quick primer on how to do so, in hopes that it might make the process a little simpler for any readers feeling how I did. 

     Before continuing I do I have to make a disclaimer that these steps can only do so much. Yesterday,  Wikileaks released a massive file known as Vault7 on CIA cyber-weapons in which it was confirmed that most of our devices and apps are susceptible to zero-day exploits by our government. While these measures will do a lot to protect against those larger data breaches, if a CIA-level hacker wants to get your information, they’re going to get it. So always remember to take great care before typing anything sensitive into a computer.

  **   Step 1: What’s The Deal?**
  		 
    My first step was taking a survey of the situation. I made a list of all of the websites I use regularly on paper, so as not to centralize or publicize my new security-center (can’t trust Google docs!) The list included all of the email services I’ve used and corresponding passwords. I checked have I been pwned to see if any of those emails were compromised by previous leaks, which luckily only a previous email long-deactivated had been. Since my hard drive was wiped recently, I felt secure about my hardware having not been compromised, so I forewent any scans on my local system.  

**     Step 2: Lock it down! **
    First, I updated my system. Updates often contain patches to vulnerabilities in previous versions, so keeping up-to-date is of the utmost importance. In order to prevent future hardware vulnerabilities I backed up my files and encrypted my hard drive with Filevault, which comes on Mac’s OS (Windows users can use Bitlocker). At this point, if I owned any IoT devices in my home, I’d proceed to smash them with a baseball bat and discard the remains. 
I also put tape over my camera on my laptop. A tad paranoid you say? What have you got to hide Max? Well, nothing. However your argument, theoretical contrarian, is what is known in the tech community as the ‘nothing to hide argument,’ which is the logical fallacy you have just illustrated. Coined by the social media researcher (yes, apparently that’s a job) Danah Boyd, it states just that governments using surveillance methods that threaten privacy are justified in breaking the law if it is uncovered that the subject has committed a crime. It’s a fallacy because much of what we do online and can be observed via our laptop cameras can be recontextualized to portray wrongdoing when there was none, not to mention it removes our right to due-process. Not to mention that the only government-provided information I found online was written by the SEC in 2005 and has extremely vague and useless tips like ‘be careful what you download’ and ‘be smart about your password’ I digress…

    To further lock-down your stration, it’s time to look to the web. Start with that old-fashioned paper list and create new passwords for each account. Make sure each password is different, and includes plenty of numbers, symbols, and as little relevant information to you (like your first pet’s name) as possible. Hard to remember? That’s okay, because we’re getting a password manager. I went with LastPass, because it’s free and my head instructor/net-sec guru Steven uses it, but there are plenty of alternatives should you want to shop around. Last, think of a nice tricky password for your LastPass account and write it down on a separate piece of paper. Keep that one in your wallet until you have it memorized, then burn it. 

     **3. Wrap it up!**
     Now that all my info’s locked down, it’s time to make sure any activity online is as secure as possible. For messaging, encrypted services like Signal and Whatsapp are the best option, although they’re still not perfect as Vault7 showed us. For better searching, Duckduckgo.com is doesn’t track its users, and if you really want to stay secure browsing on TOR and using a VPN will go a long way. As we learned this week, cookies are a widely used tool that make your life more convenient by remembering that you logged into a site during your session so you don’t have to enter it over and over again. They’re also used by advertisers (like Google) to track your activity online and see how you respond to ads, distributing data about your behavior to be used by businesses across the web. For this I use adblock plus as well as Editthiscookie (both Chrome extensions) to manage the cookies accessing me currently. 

     **4. Geek out! (optional)**
     Given that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, and that every individual requires a different level of security, step 4 is really to take a good look at your own situation/vulnerabilities and look for solutions that work best for you. Some customize their firewall settings, others put cement in their usb ports. Remembering that our government would prefer easy access to its citizens info for control, and businesses make billions from data analytics about our behavior gleaned from cookies, the responsibility lies on the individual to secure their data and assert their own right to privacy.
